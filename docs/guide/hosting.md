# Play with friends and host a server

**On Windows.** The host runs `RO3Emu.exe host`; it prints the address to share (Windows asks once whether the server
may use the network: allow it). Friends run `RO3Emu.exe join <that address>`. For friends outside your home network,
forward TCP ports `5380`, `20000` and `33100` on your router to the host and share your public IP. Party voice chat
is off unless the host adds `--voice-port 33101` (any free port); then forward that port too.

**On Linux.** Download **`RO3Emu-server-linux-x64.tar.gz`**, extract it and run `server.sh`; nothing to install:

```bash
./server.sh --client /path/to/ROO_PC --host <public IP> --gm <your account>     # a game folder copied from Windows
./server.sh --download /srv/ro3/ROO_PC --host <public IP> --gm <your account>   # or only the files it needs, from Genesis
./server.sh --service ...                                                       # install it as a systemd service
```

Open TCP `5380`, `20000` and `33100`, and the voice port if you turn voice on with `--voice-port 33101`.

**Good to know**
- **GM commands** (`!help` in chat) are on for every account when you play on your own PC. A hosted server gives them
  only to the accounts you name with `--gm` ([GM access](gm-access.md)).
- **Bug reports from players:** the Feedback button in the game menu or `/bug <text>` in chat ([feedback](feedback.md)), optionally posted to a Discord channel.
- **Monsters that attack on sight as in RO1** (on by default, as a trial): set `Ro3Emu__Ro1AggressiveMonsters=false` (or
  `"Ro1AggressiveMonsters": false` under `Ro3Emu` in `appsettings.json`) to turn it off. The field monsters whose Ragnarok Online 1
  counterpart is aggressive then attack players they see, like the few that already do. This follows RO1
  (rAthena's monster database), not the original RO3 server.
- **Backups:** the database is backed up to `data/backups/` at start and every 6 hours (newest 20 kept). All but the
  newest two are gzip-compressed (`.db.gz`, about a quarter of the size); `Ro3Emu.Server --restore-backup` takes either
  kind. `Ro3Emu__Backup__Keep`, `Ro3Emu__Backup__IntervalHours` and `Ro3Emu__Backup__Uncompressed` (or `Backup` under
  `Ro3Emu` in `appsettings.json`) change the three numbers; `Uncompressed` equal to `Keep` compresses nothing.
- **Database size:** every reward, purchase and activity writes a receipt so a lost or repeated request is never paid
  twice. Receipts older than 2 days are trimmed to their hashes every hour, in small batches
  (`Ro3Emu__ReceiptRetention__Days`, `__BatchSize`, `__IntervalMinutes`; `Days` 0 keeps them whole). The space freed
  is reused, so the file stops growing; to shrink it on disk, stop the server and run `VACUUM` on `data/ro3emu.db`
  once (`sqlite3 data/ro3emu.db "VACUUM"`).
- **One session per account:** a second login takes over from the first. The client runs one instance per PC;
  `Ro3Emu.BotCli` can stand in for extra players when you test alone.

| Hardware | Minimum | Measured target (500 players) |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | 2 cores | at most 2 cores used by the server |
| RAM | 2 GB | at most 2 GB working set |
| Disk | 3 GB plus the game | SSD recommended |

## Purchase links

The game's recharge, shop top-up and monthly-card buttons open the publisher's payment page. RO3Emu never sends a
player there: a payment made there reaches the publisher, not your server. Without any option the buttons open
nothing. To send players to your own page (donations, a store), give its address every time you patch the game:

```
RO3Emu.exe join 203.0.113.10 --purchase-url https://example.com/donate
```

`start` and `host` take the option too. Only an `http` or `https` address is accepted. The patcher writes it into the
client hooks it installs; the redirect sits on `UnityEngine.Application.OpenURL`, the call every one of those buttons
ends in (`OpenUrlPatch`, `Ro3Emu.ClientHooks.UrlRewrite`).
